# Course Basic Details API Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the successful conversion of the PostgreSQL function `get_course_basic_details` into a complete API endpoint following the system's architectural patterns and naming conventions.

## PostgreSQL Function Converted

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_course_basic_details(
    p_student_id INT DEFAULT 0,
    p_course_id INT DEFAULT 0
)
RETURNS TABLE (
    course_id INT,
    course_name TEXT,
    course_description TEXT,
    overall_progress_percentage NUMERIC,
    teacher_name TEXT,
    start_date TIMESTAMP,
    end_date TIMESTAMP,
    purchase_status "CourseType",
    program_name TEXT,
    specialization_name TEXT
)
```

## Implementation Components

### 1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)
**File**: `backend/src/dtos/course/course-basic-details.dto.ts`

**Key Features**:
- Interface for request parameters (`GetCourseBasicDetailsDto`)
- Interface for response structure (`CourseBasicDetailsResponse`)
- Express validator rules for input validation
- Handles optional student_id parameter for enhanced features
- Properly typed with nullable fields where appropriate

### 2. Service Layer
**File**: `backend/src/services/course.service.ts`
**Method**: `getCourseBasicDetails`

**Key Features**:
- Complex Prisma queries replacing the original SQL joins
- Separate queries for optimal performance and data integrity
- Comprehensive error handling with `tryCatch` wrapper
- Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring
- Type-safe response formatting

**Technical Implementation**:
- Main course query with teacher and session includes
- Separate enrollment query when student_id is provided
- Separate specialization program query for related academic data
- Separate student progress query for progress tracking
- Efficient data mapping and null handling

### 3. Controller Layer
**File**: `backend/src/controllers/course.controller.ts`
**Method**: `getCourseBasicDetailsHandler`

**Key Features**:
- Uses `createRouteHandler` utility for consistent error handling
- Parameter validation and type conversion
- Optional authentication support (public endpoint with enhanced features when authenticated)
- Proper logging of request details
- Standardized response format

### 4. Route Configuration
**File**: `backend/src/api/v1/routes/course.routes.ts`
**Route**: `GET /api/v1/courses/:courseId/basic-details`

**Key Features**:
- RESTful endpoint design following system conventions
- Public access with optional authentication for enhanced features
- Integrated validation middleware
- Parameter and query parameter validation
- Proper route documentation

## API Endpoint Details

### Endpoint
```
GET /api/v1/courses/{courseId}/basic-details?student_id={optional}
```

### Authorization
- **Public Access**: Course basic information available to all users
- **Enhanced Features**: Additional data (progress, enrollment status) when student_id is provided
- **Optional Authentication**: Works with or without authentication

### Parameters
- **Path**: `courseId` (required) - Course identifier
- **Query**: `student_id` (optional) - Student identifier for enhanced data

### Response
Returns comprehensive course details including:
- Course information (ID, name, description)
- Teacher details (name from first assigned teacher)
- Course session dates (from earliest session)
- Purchase status (based on enrollment)
- Academic context (program and specialization)
- Progress tracking (when student_id provided)

## Technical Highlights

### 1. Flexible Access Model
- Public endpoint for basic course information
- Enhanced features when student context is provided
- No authentication required for basic course browsing

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- Separate targeted queries instead of complex joins
- Efficient data fetching with strategic `select` clauses
- Minimal overhead for public access scenarios

### 3. Data Integrity
- Comprehensive null handling throughout the pipeline
- Proper fallback values for missing data
- Safe type conversions and validations

### 4. Purchase Status Logic
- Matches original PostgreSQL function logic
- Shows "PURCHASED" when student is enrolled
- Falls back to course type when no enrollment exists

## Database Queries Conversion

### Original SQL Logic
The PostgreSQL function used complex LEFT JOINs across multiple tables:
- `courses` as base table
- LEFT JOIN `enrollments` for purchase status
- LEFT JOIN `course_sessions` for dates
- LEFT JOIN `student_course_progresses` for progress
- INNER JOIN `teacher_courses` â†’ `teachers` for instructor info
- Complex JOIN chain through `specialization_programs` for academic context

### Prisma Implementation
Converted to:
1. Main course query with teacher and session includes
2. Conditional enrollment query when student_id provided
3. Conditional specialization program query for academic context
4. Conditional progress query for tracking data
5. Efficient data mapping in application layer

## Business Logic Preservation

### Purchase Status Logic
- **Original**: `CASE WHEN e.course_id IS NULL THEN c.course_type ELSE 'PURCHASED' END`
- **Implemented**: Same logic with enrollment check determining status

### Data Relationships
- Maintains all original table relationships
- Preserves filtering logic (active, non-deleted records)
- Handles nullable relationships appropriately

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing
- Service method with various parameter combinations
- Error scenarios (course not found, invalid IDs)
- Data consistency with different enrollment states

### Integration Testing
- End-to-end API endpoint testing
- Public access functionality
- Enhanced features with student context
- Response format validation

## Documentation Updated

### API Documentation
Updated `documentation/api-designs/course-management-api.md` with:
- Complete endpoint specification
- Request/response examples
- Use cases and business rules
- Access control documentation

## Deployment Notes

### Database Requirements
- No additional migrations required
- Uses existing table relationships
- Leverages current indexing structure

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor query performance for popular courses
- Watch for N+1 query patterns
- Consider caching for frequently accessed courses

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for course basic details
2. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages in course details
3. **Additional Fields**: Extend with more course metadata as needed
4. **Batch Operations**: Support for fetching multiple courses at once

### Scalability Considerations
- Current implementation handles moderate to high loads efficiently
- Separate queries provide better performance than complex joins
- Easy to add caching layer when needed

## Conclusion

The PostgreSQL function has been successfully converted to a complete, production-ready API endpoint that:
- Maintains the original functionality and business logic
- Follows system architectural patterns and naming conventions
- Implements proper error handling and validation
- Supports both public access and enhanced authenticated features
- Includes comprehensive documentation
- Provides flexible access patterns for different use cases

The implementation is ready for integration testing and production deployment, offering improved performance and maintainability over the original SQL function.
